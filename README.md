Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software Engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software.
-Software Engineering is important in the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages such as C and Fortran. This was in the 1950s to simplify programming and make software development more accessile. 
- The establishment of software engineering principles in 1960s. This emphasized on clear logical flow in code.
- The rise of agile methodology as a response to limitations of Waterfall model in 2000s. This ensured iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and software initial requirements.
- Design: Creating detailed design specification of every component in the system including user interfaces.
- Implementation: Writing codes and building software according to design specifications.
- Testing: Conducting tests to validate that the software meets the requirements of quality and functionality.
- Deployment: Releasing the software for use to the end-users.
- Maintenance: Providing improvements and updates to ensure the software functions effectively and remains up-to-date.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall and Agile methodologies are both fundamental approaches to software development process. 
However, each has distinct characteristics and best-suited scenarios.
-The Waterfall model follows a linear, step-by-step approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins flowing downwards like a waterfall. A scenario is such as Government Contracts that need a custom software system for managing public records and the requirements are detailed and unlikely to change, making the Waterfall model appropriate for ensuring all specifications are met before moving on to the next phase. Whereas The Agile Metholodogy emphasizes iterative development with incremental delivery of features and projects are divided into small iterations or sprints. A scenario would be a startup developing a new mobile app that needs to quickly adapt to user feedback and market changes. Agile allows them to deliver incremental features, gather user feedback, and pivot as necessary to better meet user needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- A Software Developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
- A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. eg Visual Studio, Eclipse, intelliJIDEA.
-Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. eg Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Challenges include changing requirements during development cycle, tight deadlines to deliver software products on schedule that compromises quality, and technical debt that can impede future developments and increase maintenance costs.
-Strategies for overcoming the challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing involves individual components and modules of software.
- Integration Testing involves interactions between different components or subsystems.
- System Testing involves the entire software system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
-It is important as it ensures that AI gives clear, concise, context-specific answers

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-A vague prompt would look like "write for me a recipe for soup" AI might give a general answer to this. Instead, an improved prompt such as "write for me a recipe for pumpkin soup" - AI would be clear on the specific ingredients for this soup.
